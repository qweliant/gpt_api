### The goall of this repo is provide an API endpoint for GPT2 generated text using huggingfaces https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html#overview

# Since I am using AWS to host the end, the API will not be live. This is really to test deployment procedures for pre-trained models and using endpoints to train a live model for RTL
 
# to get started make sure you have AWS credentials and the CLI set up. Install cortex (https://www.cortex.dev/install) as well. Follow their tutorial in spinning up a cluster. It may take a few minutes, so do not fret. 

# after tha, run `cortex deploy`, then `cortex get <name>`. mine is qwelian but you can change the name to your choice
